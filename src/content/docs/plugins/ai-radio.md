# AI Radio Plugin

AI Radio turns one of your playlists into a radio-style show with spoken host segments between tracks. The host can introduce songs, bridge from one track to the next, add occasional weather or news breaks, and save the finished program as a playlist or play it live through a Music Assistant player.

:::note
AI Radio is currently in beta. The show editor, prompt presets, generated output, and advanced station format may change between Music Assistant releases.
:::

## Features

- Create reusable **shows** from Music Assistant playlists
- Pick a bundled host style such as **Morning show**, **Minimal DJ**, **Music nerd**, or **Party host**
- Choose how often the host speaks with the talkativeness setting
- Generate spoken sections with an AI provider and synthesize them with a TTS provider
- Play a show live through a Music Assistant player
- Generate a completed show and save it as a Music Assistant playlist
- Customize each segment's prompt, timing, web-search behavior, and character limit
- Use placeholders such as `<prev_songinfo>`, `<next_songinfo>`, `<timestamp>`, and `<weather_hourly>`
- Add optional weather updates through Open-Meteo when a weather location is configured
- Duplicate existing shows to create variations without starting from scratch

## Requirements

- The **AI Radio** plugin must be enabled in **Settings → Plugins → Add a Plugin**.
- At least one playlist with playable tracks.
- A configured provider that supports AI queries, such as the [Home Assistant plugin](/ha-plugin/) with LLM access.
- A configured provider that supports TTS, such as the [Home Assistant plugin](/ha-plugin/) with a working text-to-speech service.
- For live playback, an enabled and available Music Assistant player.

:::note
AI Radio generates new speech each time a show is started. The exact wording can vary even when the same show and playlist are used.

## Installation

### Setting up AI and TTS with Home Assistant

AI Radio does not contain its own LLM or TTS engine. It asks Music Assistant for providers that expose AI-query and text-to-speech features. The most common setup is to use the [Home Assistant plugin](/ha-plugin/) as the bridge to Home Assistant's Assist/LLM and TTS services.

Before configuring AI Radio:

1. Install the [Home Assistant integration](/integration/installation/) if your Music Assistant server is not already connected to Home Assistant.
2. Add or verify the [Home Assistant plugin](/ha-plugin/) in Music Assistant.
3. In Home Assistant, configure the LLM/conversation agent you want Music Assistant to use.
4. In Home Assistant, configure a TTS service and test that it can speak a short message.
5. In the Music Assistant Home Assistant plugin settings, select the **Text-to-Speech entity** and **AI Task entity** under **Features**.
6. Return to Music Assistant and open AI Radio. If Music Assistant can see an AI-query provider and a TTS provider, the AI Radio page becomes usable.

:::tip
If AI Radio reports that an AI provider or TTS provider is missing, test the Home Assistant plugin first. AI Radio only sees capabilities that the plugin exposes to Music Assistant.
:::

### Configure the Plugin

1. Go to **Settings → Plugins → Add a Plugin**.
2. Add **AI Radio**.
3. Configure the optional plugin settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Timezone** | Used for timestamp placeholders and local date formatting. Defaults to the server timezone. |
| **Weather city** | City used when a show segment contains weather placeholders. |
| **Weather country** | Country used together with the city for weather lookup. |

Weather is optional. Shows without weather segments do not need a weather location.

## Creating a show

1. Open **AI Radio** from the Music Assistant sidebar.
2. Select **Create show**.
3. Choose a **Source playlist**.
4. Select a **Host style**.
5. Choose a **Talkativeness** level.
6. Give the show a name.
7. Select **Create** or **Create & play**.

The create dialog is meant to get a useful show running quickly. You can fine-tune the show later with **Customize**.

## Playing a show

Each show card has two main run options.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Play** | Starts a live AI Radio run on the selected player. Music Assistant prepares the first batch of tracks and host segments, queues them, then continues preparing more while playback is running. |
| **Generate and save as playlist** | Builds the complete show in the background and saves it as a Music Assistant playlist. Use this when you want a reusable generated episode instead of live generation. |

Only one AI Radio run can be active at a time. If another show is already on air, Music Assistant asks whether to stop it and switch to the selected show.

## Customizing a show

Select **Customize** on a show card to edit its basics, segments, and advanced settings.

### Basics

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Show name** | Display name for the show. |
| **Source playlist** | Playlist used as the music source. |
| **Default playback device** | Player used by the **Play** action. This can be left empty and selected later. |

### Segments

A segment is one spoken part of the show. A segment has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Segment name** | Name shown in the editor and in generated playlist entries. |
| **Prompt** | Instructions sent to the AI for this spoken section. |
| **Web Search Mode** | Whether the AI may use web search for this segment. |
| **Character Limit** | Soft maximum length for the generated text before TTS. |
| **Plays** | When and how often the segment should be inserted. |

The simple editor supports these timing choices:

- **Once at start**
- **Once at end**
- **Every song**
- **Every ~N songs**
- **Every ~N min**
- **Occasionally**, with a percentage

If more than one between-song segment is due at the same point, AI Radio can draft those segments separately and merge them into one spoken host break. For example, a song transition and a weather segment can become one moderator line that knows both the next song and the weather.

### Web search modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **disabled** | The AI should rely on the prompt and track metadata only. |
| **allow** | The AI may use web search if the AI provider supports it. |
| **force** | The segment requires web search. This is useful for current-news style segments. |

Use web search sparingly. It can improve current or factual segments, but it can also make generation slower and depends on the capabilities of the configured AI provider.

### Prompt placeholders

AI Radio replaces placeholders in prompts before sending them to the AI.

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<prev_songinfo>` | Artist/title information for the previous track, when available. |
| `<next_songinfo>` | Artist/title information for the next track, when available. |
| `<very_next_songinfo>` | Artist/title information for the track after the next track, when available. |
| `<timestamp>` | Current local time based on the AI Radio timezone setting. |
| `<weather_hourly>` | Current and near-future weather summary, when weather is configured. |
| `<weather_daily>` | Daily weather summary, when weather is configured. |

Example prompt:

```text
The previous track was <prev_songinfo> and the next track is <next_songinfo>.
Create a natural radio transition that connects both songs and keeps it concise.
```

## Sharing a show

A show can be handed to someone else as a small JSON document.

To share one, open the show's `⋯` menu and choose **Share…**. The dialog shows the document; use
**Copy JSON** to put it on the clipboard or **Download .json** to save it as a file.

To import one, choose **New show** and switch to **Import a shared show**. Paste the document or load
the `.json` file, pick a source playlist from your own library, and create the show as usual.

What travels: the show name, the host and program instructions, and every segment with its prompt,
web search mode, character limit and timing rule.

What does not: the source playlist, the default playback device, and the advanced settings. Those are
specific to the instance the show came from, so the importer picks their own playlist and the
advanced settings start at their defaults.

:::caution[Only import shows from someone you trust]
The prompts in a shared show are instructions written by whoever shared it, and they are sent to your
AI provider along with the values AI Radio substitutes into them — your weather location, your local
time and the tracks being played. A segment with web search enabled can cause that information to
leave your network. Read the prompts before importing a show from a stranger.
:::

## Advanced settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| **Host and Program Instructions** | Preset-specific | Overall host personality and writing style. This is sent with every generated segment. |
| **Source Playtime Cap (minutes)** | 0 | Limits the total source music used for a run. Set to `0` for no limit. Tracks are sampled randomly until the cap is reached. |
| **Dynamic Batch Size** | 3 | Number of source tracks prepared at a time in live mode. Larger batches reduce mid-show waiting but can increase startup time and token usage. |
| **Clear Queue on Dynamic Start** | On | Clears the selected player's queue before live playback. Turn it off to append the show after the current queue instead. |

## Weather segments

AI Radio uses Open-Meteo for weather placeholders. To use weather:

1. Configure **Weather city** and **Weather country** in the AI Radio plugin settings.
2. Add or keep a segment whose prompt contains `<weather_hourly>` or `<weather_daily>`.
3. Use a timing rule such as **Every ~60 min** or **Occasionally** so weather does not appear too often.

If weather lookup fails or the location is missing, AI Radio skips weather placeholder content rather than stopping the whole show.

## Generated playlists

When you select **Generate and save as playlist**, Music Assistant creates a new playlist containing:

- The generated TTS host sections
- The selected source tracks
- Stable metadata for the AI Radio sections

Generated playlists are useful for testing a show format, saving an episode, or playing the result later without waiting for live generation.

## Live mode

When you select **Play**, AI Radio runs in dynamic mode:

1. It samples source tracks from the selected playlist.
2. It plans the first batch of host segments.
3. It generates AI text and TTS audio.
4. It queues the generated host audio and music.
5. While playback continues, it prepares later batches before the queue reaches them.

If **Clear Queue on Dynamic Start** is enabled, the selected queue is replaced. If disabled, AI Radio appends the show after the current queue and waits for the correct playback position before adding later batches.

## Tips

- Start with **Minimal DJ** if you want fewer interruptions.
- Use **Music nerd** with web search allowed for artist facts and context.
- Use **Morning show** if you want weather and news-style breaks.
- Keep segment prompts short and direct. The best prompts describe the exact role of the segment and mention that the text is for spoken delivery.
- Use character limits to keep TTS sections from becoming too long.
- Generate a playlist first when experimenting with new prompts. It is easier to review the complete result before using live playback.

## Troubleshooting

### AI Radio says an AI provider is needed

Configure a plugin that supports AI queries. The [Home Assistant plugin](/ha-plugin/) can provide this when it has access to an LLM/conversation service.

### No speech is generated

Check that a TTS-capable provider is configured and working. AI Radio needs both AI text generation and TTS synthesis. With Home Assistant, test the TTS service there first, then verify that the [Home Assistant plugin](/ha-plugin/) is connected in Music Assistant.

### Live playback will not start

Make sure the selected player is enabled, available, and not hidden. If the show has no default playback device, select one before pressing **Play**.

### Weather segments are empty or skipped

Confirm that **Weather city** and **Weather country** are configured in the AI Radio plugin settings. Weather is currently provided by Open-Meteo.

### A customized show warns that it will be simplified on save

Some advanced station configurations cannot be represented perfectly in the simple show editor. Saving rewrites the show into the simplified segment format used by the UI.
